Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project uses machine learning to train a logistic regression model to identify rocks and mines from sonar data. Sonar is a technology that uses sound waves to detect objects underwater. It is commonly used by submarines to navigate and avoid hazards.

The model was trained on a dataset of sonar signals from both rocks and mines. The model learns to identify the features in the sonar signals that are most predictive of whether the signal is from a rock or a mine.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to identify rocks and mines from new sonar signals. This can help submarines to avoid hazards and navigate safely.
 The accuracy score for this project was extracted using accuracy score function which resulted in training accuracy score as 83% and testing accuracy score as 76%.
